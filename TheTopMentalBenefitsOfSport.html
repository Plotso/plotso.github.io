                <h4><strong><em>Sports improve your mood</em></strong></h4>
                <p style="text-align: left"><img src="http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/topic_centers/Fitness-Exercise/1296x728_The_Top_8_Mental_Benefits_of_Sports-ImporveMood.jpg" width="500"/></p>
                Want a burst of happiness and relaxation? Get involved in a physical activity. Whether you are playing sports, working out at a gym, or taking a brisk walk, physical activity triggers brain chemicals that make you feel happier and more relaxed. Team sports in particular provide a chance to unwind and engage in a satisfying challenge that improves your fitness. They also provide social benefits by allowing you to connect with teammates and friends in a recreational setting.
                <h4><strong><em>Sports improve your concentration</em></strong></h4>
                <p style="text-align: left"><img src="http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/topic_centers/Fitness-Exercise/1296x728_The_Top_8_Mental_Benefits_of_Sports-Concentration.jpg" width="500"/></p>
                Regular physical activity helps keep your key mental skills sharp as you age. This includes critical thinking, learning, and using good judgment. Research has shown that doing a mix of aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities is especially helpful. Participating in this kind of activity three to five times a week for at least 30 minutes can provide these mental health benefits.
                <h4><strong><em>Sports reduce stress and depression</em></strong></h4>
                <p style="text-align: left"><img src="http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/topic_centers/Fitness-Exercise/1296x728_The_Top_8_Mental_Benefits_of_Sports-ReduceStress.jpg" width="500"/></p>
                When you are physically active, your mind is distracted from daily stressors. This can help you avoid getting bogged down by negative thoughts. Exercise reduces the levels of stress hormones in your body. At the same time, it stimulates production of endorphins. These are natural mood lifters that can keep stress and depression at bay. Endorphins may even leave you feeling more relaxed and optimistic after a hard workout.
                <h4><strong><em>Sports improve sleep habits</em></strong></h4>
                <p style="text-align: left"><img src="http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/topic_centers/Fitness-Exercise/1296x728_The_Top_8_Mental_Benefits_of_Sports-Sleep.jpg" width="500"/></p>
                Sports and other forms of physical activity improve the quality of sleep. They do this by helping you fall asleep faster and deepening your sleep. Sleeping better can improve your mental outlook the next day, as well as improve your mood. Just be careful not to engage in sports too late in the day. Evening practices within a few hours of bedtime may leave you too energized to sleep.
                <h4><strong><em>Sports help you maintain a healthy weight</em></strong></h4>
                <p style="text-align: left"><img src="http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/topic_centers/Fitness-Exercise/1296x728_The_Top_8_Mental_Benefits_of_Sports-HealthyWeight.jpg" width="500"/></p>
                The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend sports participation as a healthy way to maintain weight. Individual sports, such as running, cycling, and weightlifting, are all particularly effective ways to burn calories and/or build muscle. Staying within a recommended weight range reduces the likelihood of developing diabetes, high cholesterol, and hypertension.
                <h4><strong><em>Sports boost your self-confidence</em></strong></h4>
                <p style="text-align: left"><img src="http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/topic_centers/Fitness-Exercise/1296x728_The_Top_8_Mental_Benefits_of_Sports-Confidence.jpg" width="500"/></p>
                The regular exercise that comes with playing sports can boost your confidence and improve your self-esteem. As your strength, skills, and stamina increase through playing sports, your self-image will improve as well. With the renewed vigor and energy that comes from physical activity, you may be more likely to succeed in tasks off the playing field as well as on it.
                <h4><strong><em>Sports have been linked to leadership traits</em></strong></h4>
                <p style="text-align: left"><img src="http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/topic_centers/Fitness-Exercise/1296x728_The_Top_8_Mental_Benefits_of_Sports-Leadership.jpg" width="500"/></p>
                Team sports such as soccer, baseball, and basketball are breeding grounds for leadership traits. Studies done in high schools reveal a correlation between sports participation and leadership qualities. Because of the opportunity to train, try, win, or lose together, people involved in sports are naturally more inclined to adopt a “team mindset” in the workplace and in social situations. The team mindset leads to strong leadership qualities over time.
